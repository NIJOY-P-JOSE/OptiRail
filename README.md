# 🚆 AI-Driven Train Scheduling System for Kochi Metro

An intelligent decision-support platform built with Python and Django to automate and optimize the daily train induction and scheduling process for Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL).



## 📜 About The Project

Kochi Metro's nightly scheduling process is a complex, time-sensitive manual task. Supervisors have a two-hour window to reconcile six different data streams—from fitness certificates to mileage logs—to decide which trains run the next day. This process is error-prone, inefficient, and not scalable for KMRL's planned fleet expansion.

Our solution is a centralized AI platform that transforms this manual task into an automated, data-driven, and predictive operation. It integrates all critical data, uses a machine learning model to generate an optimized daily roster, and provides staff with an interactive dashboard for complete operational oversight.
